# How to build a website using React

React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. In this guide, we'll walk through the process of creating a modern website using React and Next.js.

## Getting Started

First, you'll need to set up your development environment. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer.

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-website
cd my-website
npm run dev
```

## Key Concepts

### Components

React is all about components. Here's a simple example:

```jsx
function Greeting({ name }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>
}
```

### Routing

Next.js provides a file-system based router. Simply create files in your `pages` directory:

```jsx
// pages/about.js
export default function About() {
  return <h1>About Us</h1>
}
```

## Styling Your Website

You can use various styling solutions with React. We recommend using Tailwind CSS:

```jsx
function Button({ children }) {
  return (
    <button className="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded-md hover:bg-blue-600">
      {children}
    </button>
  )
}
```

## Conclusion

Building websites with React can be both fun and productive. Keep practicing and exploring new features!
